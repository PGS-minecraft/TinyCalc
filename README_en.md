# TinyCalc - A Clean and Compact C++ Calculator
## About TinyCalc
- This program is a **fully free and open-source** calculator software written in **`[C++]`**, supporting **arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)** and compatible with **multiple versions of Windows**.
- The program currently only supports **basic arithmetic operations** and does not include other calculation methods such as **scientific notation**.
- For the latest version of the project, please refer to the **`[Releases]`** section which includes both past and current releases.
- *Note: There are several areas in the code that need improvement and correction.*

## Running Instructions
1. Open the source code file **`[TinyCalc_***.cpp]`** in any **C++ code editor**.
2. **Compile** and **run** the code.
- Alternatively, you can **download a pre-compiled executable**.
- As the packaged program uses **dynamic compilation**, please also download the required **dll files provided by the author**.
- *If the executable can be run directly, skip this step.*

## Usage Guide
- After running the program, the user needs to input an **arithmetic expression**.
- Format for arithmetic expressions: **[First set of numbers] [Operator] [Second set of numbers]**.
- Upon receiving the input, the program performs the **corresponding operation based on the entered operator** and then **displays the result**.
- If the operator entered by the user is **not one of the four basic arithmetic operators**, the program will display an **error message** and **prompt the user to re-enter**.
- In the case where the operator is **division** and the **divisor is zero**, the program will show an error message of **`[Divisor cannot be 0]`** and **require the user to re-enter**.
- To **exit the program**, please enter **`end`** to close it.
